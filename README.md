Exercism exercises in Python

## Contributing Guide

Please see the [contributing guide](https://github.com/exercism/x-api/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#the-exercise-data)

## Working on the Exercises

We welcome both improvements to the existing exercises and new exercises.
A pool of exercise ideas can be found in the [x-common repo](https://github.com/exercism/x-common).

All exercises must be compatible with Python versions 2.7 and 3.3 upwards.
Therefore please test your changes at least with Python2.7 and Python3.5.

To test a single exercise, say crypto-square, run:
```
python2.7 test/check-exercises.py crypto-square
```
and
```
python3.5 test/check-exercises.py crypto-square
```

To run the tests for all exercises type:
```
python test/check-exercises.py
```

## Code Style

The Python code in this repo is meant to largely obey the [PEP8 style guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) (not all code does though).
Try the [flake8](http://flake8.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) tool if you feel unsure about questions of style.
